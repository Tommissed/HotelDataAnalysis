Hotel Data Analysis - Power BI Project

This project is part of my Data Analysis Portfolio

Project Summary

This interactive Power BI report analyzes hotel booking data to uncover insights related to:

- Booking trends
- Revenue by market segment
- Stay duration patterns
- Seasonal performance
- Lead time distribution
- Cancellation rates

Technologies Used

- Power BI Desktop (report building and data modeling)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions for custom metrics)
- Power Query (data transformation and ETL)

The report dashboard includes ways to filter for hotels by their type, as well as by which Country the hotel is in. Users are also able to filter by specific dates

Future Improvements

- Add Excel-based data source to repo for transparency
- Create version using CSV files for portability
- Expand to multi-hotel comparison
- Integrate SQL-based data cleaning for raw datasets
