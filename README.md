Hotel Data Analysis - Power BI Project

Project Summary

This interactive Power BI report analyzes hotel booking data to uncover insights related to:

- Booking trends
- Revenue by market segment
- Stay duration patterns
- Seasonal performance
- Lead time distribution
- Cancellation rates

Project Objectives & Insights

1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
   - Yes, the total revenue has increased year over year.
   - The line chart visualizes annual revenue growth. We can see that over time, the daily revenue rate of our hotels is increasing. This can be easily understood by the trend lines showcased in the Sum of Revenue line graph
   - We can also notice that there seems to be a difference in amount of growth when it comes to City Hotels vs Resort Hotels, with City Hotels having a much more notable growth.

2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
   - Not necessarily. It seems that the percentage of users using the parking facilities has remained stagnant over the years, so increasing the parking lot size is not recommended.
  
3. What trends can we see in the data?
   - 
  


Technologies Used

- Power BI Desktop (report building and data modeling)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions for custom metrics)
- Power Query (data transformation and ETL)

The report dashboard includes ways to filter for hotels by their type, as well as by which Country the hotel is in. Users are also able to filter by specific dates

Future Improvements

- Add Excel-based data source to repo for transparency
- Create version using CSV files for portability
- Expand to multi-hotel comparison
- Integrate SQL-based data cleaning for raw datasets
